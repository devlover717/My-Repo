<!-- meta tags  -->
metadata is data about data. 


these are some example of meta tags

the desctiption of our webpage 
<meta name="description" content="Free tutorial on HTML">
<meta name="keywords" content="tutorial, html, free, studens">
<meta name="author" content="M.Osama">

now about display of the website 
<meta name="viewport" content="width=device-width, initial-scale=1.0">

character set 
<meta charset="UTF-8">



metadata actually gives info to the browser about our page




<!-- id -->
id is always unique , it cant be duplicated in single page
id can be used with any tag bcs it is a global tag


global attributes sab tags ke sath use ho sakte hain like 
id tag



<!-- class  -->
class is classification 
just like in biology that we belong this class of mammals
etc.. 

ofcourse 
then class could be used with multiple tags at a time 

like

<ul class="science">
    <li>Biology</li>
    <li>Chemistry</li>
    <li>Physics</li>
</ul>

means that this whole list belongs to the class 
of science 




<!-- div n span  -->

the most important tags of html 
div and span  

div, div works like a small container which 
groups TEXT AND TAGS together.
like 
in facebook , chatbox is a container,  it is made using 
div  So, in this way div tag works. 


div and  span both work the same but the difference is 

<!-- div is blocklevel  --> and 
<!-- span is inline -->

so the content wrapped in them become either blocklevel or
inline.

The <div> element allows you to
    group a set of elements together
    in one block-level box



or you can say div is used to make sections of a webpage.


so, to make a code blocklevel, you just wrap it inside 
a div tag 



The most common reason why
people use <span> elements
is so that they can control the
appearance of the content of
these elements using CSS.
